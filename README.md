# Component Lifecycle Methods

This is a short exercise for exploring React's component lifecycle methods.

## Mounting Lifecycle Methods

First, add the mounting lifecycle methods to the `HomePage` component. The mounting lifecycle methods are:

* `constructor()`
* `render()`
* `componentDidMount()`
* `componentWillUnmount()`

In each method, console log the name of the component and the name of the method being called.

## Updating Lifecycle Methods

Second, add the updating lifecycle methods to the `AboutPage` component. The updating lifecycle methods are:

* `shouldComponentUpdate()`
* `render()`
* `componentDidUpdate()`

In each method, console log the name of the component and the name of the method being called.


## Observing!

Once all the methods are added, click the `+` and `-` buttons and watch what happens in your console!
